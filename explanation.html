      <h2>How to Erase</h2>
      <p>
	Erasure is done here using a special syntax in the "text to
	erase" box to the left of the <button>Erase!</button> button.
	<br/>
	At a very basic level, you can type in a literal word that you
	want to erase in the box and every instance of that word will
	be erased.
	The patterns below can be combined in any way, and the gallery
	below provides some examples of combined patterns.
	Caution should be taken when using these patterns with large
	samples of text, as the processing time for tagging and NLP
	can be quite large and slow down and freeze web browsers.
	<br/>
	In this guide, I highlighted just a few features of the
	underlying technology for erasure that I think are the most
	applicable to the domain of literature that this tool is
	intended for.
	For a more comprehensive overview of the syntax, pleace check
	out
	the <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/compromise/wiki/Match-syntax">reference
	page</a> in the comprimise.js repository, which is what powers
	this project.
      </p>
      <div class="erase-tutorial">
      <h3>Parts of Speech (Tags)</h3>
      <p>To erase tags, type in a pound sign followed by the
	appropriate tag, i.e. <code>#Noun</code> to erase all
	nouns.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="erase-tutorial">
	<h3>Suffix, Prefixes, and Infixes</h3>
	<p>Using an underscore character servers as a wildcard for
	  any amount of characters, so <code>_ed</code> erases all
	  words ending in -ed, <code>_in_</code> erases any words
	  with 'in' in the middle, and so on
	</p>
      </div>
      <div class="erase-tutorial">
	<h3>This or That</h3>
	<p>You can define a list of things that could possibly be
	  matched by enclosing them in parentheses and seperating them
	  by pipes. For example, <code>(run|dash|sprint)</code> will
	  match a group of fast words,
	  or <code>(very|really|#adverb)</code> will erase text
	  according to a selection of writing advice from established authors.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="erase-tutorial">
	<h3>Anything, Everything, and Nothing</h3>
	<p> A general wildcard expression is just a period (<code>.</code>), and
	  matches to any kind of word. <code>#noun . .</code> erases
	  any noun followed by two words of any kind.
	  <br/>
	  A greedy wildcard matches to at least one and maybe more of
	  a given token in a row. <code>#noun+</code> erases any amount of
	  nouns in a row, such as "John, Mark, Luke".
	  <br/>
	  A potential marker optionally matches a word, but doesn't
	  require it. An example is <code>#person [#adverb]?
	  runs</code>, which would erase both the sentence "John runs"
	  and "John swiftly runs".
	</p>
      </div>
      <div class="erase-tutorial">
	<h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
	<p>
	  Regular expression syntax works as well on the text here,
	  although slower than many other erasing strategies. All
	  that's needed is enclose the regular expression
	  in <code>/.../</code> forward slashes.
	</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Other Features</h2>
      <h3>Inversion</h3>
      <p>Pressing invert is a neat feature that flips the erased and
      normal text around. I have found it just as useful for creating
	cool erasure work.</p>
      <h3>Uploads</h3>
      <p>The upload button creates a large box where you can paste in
      text, and a url box for text file urls. Many sites that host
      text files do not allow them to be cross-referenced or
	downloaded by this tool, so pasting in text is recommended.
	<br/>
      Note that all pasted text will keep it's original format on the
      web page.</p>
